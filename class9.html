    <p>Hershey's is famous for its unique tangy taste from a lipolysis process on milk, making it different from European
    chocolate, with the world's largest chocolate factory in Hershey, PA, producing millions of treats like Kisses (since
    1907) and S'mores (Girl Scout recipe in 1927). Milton Hershey built a town for his workers, and the company's scale is
    immense, with automated lines producing thousands of bars per minute and using vast amounts of cocoa from West Africa.
